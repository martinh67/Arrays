# Arrays

My sixth assignment using Java:

Use a 1-D array to solve the following problem: Write an application that asks the user to input five numbers, each between 10 and 100 (inclusive). As each number is read, display it only if it is not a duplicate of a number already read. Provide for the "worst case‚Äù in which all five numbers are different. Use the smallest possible array to solve this problem. Display the 
completesetof unique values input after the user inputs each new value.
